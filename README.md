# Introduction and Motivation

PlantPro is an application designed for helping field botanists and plant enthusiasts document sightings of new or existing plants. It provides a platform, similar to reddit, for submitting pictures and sighting locations for different plant while allowing users to engage with and provide feedback for these submissions. PlantPro was originally created as a final project for Dr. Matthew Stephan's Software Engineering course at Miami University. PlantPro is open source software licensed under the MIT License. 

# Getting Started

PlantPro is designed using Laravel, and is meant to run on an Ubuntu server (we the latest release, but it's up to you). In order to install PlantPro:
   1.  Get Ubuntu running on your machine or on a virtual machine if you don't already have it
   2.  [Download our build script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudiejd/PlantPro/master/build/init.sh) (right click that link, save as, save it as init.sh).
   3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded our script in terminal and run `sudo bash init.sh`.
   4. If everything is working correctly, you should receive notification from the script that PlantPro is up and running.
   5. Navigate to http://localhost in your browser to view the PlantPro website
   6. Create the first account for this website. We have this account set up with administrator privileges by default.
   7. Enjoy! Further user documentation can be found in the docs folder of this repository and developer documentation can be found as comments within our code. Feel free to modify the starting code to your liking.
